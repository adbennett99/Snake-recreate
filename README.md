# Snake-recreate
This is my first attempt at recreating the classic game of Snake. 
This was created using Python's "pygame" library as well as the "mysql-connector-python" library.
For this project to work, a sql database must be set up with a table titles "highscores" consisting of two columns.
(You could of course change the name in the code)

The first column must be of type "Text"
The second column must be of type "int"
